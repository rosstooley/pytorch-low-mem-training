# pytorch-low-mem-training
_Implementing memory-saving techniques for training WideResNet-50-2 and Transformer in PyTorch._

```pytorch-low-mem-training.ipynb``` contains the source code, experiments and graphs from my project report. This is best viewed in an IDE like Google Colab because there are lots of long log outputs in the notebook. Within the notebook, the source code is under the top-level sections called _Models_ and _Training_, then the graphs are produced in the last top-level section called _Evaluation_. The Notebook is designed to run on a Google Colab GPU runtime.
